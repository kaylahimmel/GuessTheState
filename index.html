    <h1>Word Guess Game</h1>

    <!-- need to make array of states (maybe do curly brackets with a bunch of arrays like in the ?) -->

    <!-- need to assign key events to listen for user's typed options -->

    <!-- need to assign .Lowercase to make sure game still works if user tries to capitalize letters using shift or caps lock -->
     
    <!-- need to show user "_ _ _ _" instead of actual answer -->

    <!-- need counter that counts down from 12 the number of wrong guesses -->

    <!-- need to display the letters already guessed (and make sure if they hit the same keys again, it doesn't count against the # of wrong guesses) -->

    <!-- need counter that keeps track of wins and losses -->
